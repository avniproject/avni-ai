## Workflow on the Field

1. **Home Registration**
   - Community health workers visit homes with pregnant women.
   - Register the woman and households into the app.

2. **Sample Collection & Lab Tracking**
   - Collect blood samples and register them into the app.
   - Track sample delivery to the lab and entry of test results back into the system.

3. **Family Screening**
   - If the pregnant woman tests positive (carrier or disease), her family members are registered and tested via the same workflow.

4. **Treatment Initiation & Follow-up**
   - Positive cases are enrolled into treatment.
   - The app schedules and tracks regular treatment follow-ups, ensuring continuity of care.

5. **Dashboard Monitoring**
   - Supervisors monitor every stage—registration, testing, results, treatment—to identify bottlenecks and ensure timely completion of all steps.
