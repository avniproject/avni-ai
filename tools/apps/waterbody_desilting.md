# Waterbody Desilting Monitoring

## Splash Screen Summary
*A field data collection app to monitor the desilting of ponds, lakes, and dams — ensuring transparency, accuracy, and accountability in waterbody restoration projects.*

---

## Purpose of the App
The app is designed to help organizations track and monitor the desilting of waterbodies such as ponds, lakes, and dams.  
It allows field teams to capture structured data, photos, videos, and GPS locations directly from the site — even in offline conditions.  

The goal is to ensure accurate, transparent, and real-time information about desilting, silt removal, bund strengthening, and other restoration activities.

## Workflow on the Field

### Registration
- Field worker registers each waterbody (pond, lake, or dam) in the app with details like name, location, and baseline information.  

### Activity Logging
- During site visits, the worker records activities such as desilting, bund repair, or silt transportation.  
- GPS location and photos/videos are captured to validate work done.  

### Beneficiary / Resource Tracking (if applicable)
- Details of farmers or villages benefiting from the silt are recorded.  
- Usage of machinery and fuel can also be logged.  

### Offline Data Capture
- All information is entered offline while on the field.  
- Once internet is available, the data automatically syncs to the central server.  

### Review and Follow-up
- Supervisors view collected data to check progress.  
- Issues or missing reports can be flagged, and field staff can be contacted for clarifications.
