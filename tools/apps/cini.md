## Purpose of the App
This app digitises and streamlines the work of Community Resource Persons (CRPs) and Block Resource Persons (BRPs) in the education sector. It enables field staff to collect structured data—such as student assessments, classroom observations, attendance, library usage, and training activities—directly from schools and Anganwadis. The app empowers real-time tracking and scheduled follow-ups, improving the quality and responsiveness of education interventions in rural and tribal areas.
