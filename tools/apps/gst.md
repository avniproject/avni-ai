# GST Health Programme

## Splash Screen Summary
*A community health app for volunteers to register households, screen individuals, and track conditions like diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, mental health, and anaemia — ensuring timely care and follow-up.*

---

## Purpose of the App
The app supports a health programme run by village-based volunteers, mostly women.  
It enables them to register households and individuals, conduct screenings for multiple conditions, enrol patients for follow-up care, and track outcomes.  

The purpose is to ensure **early detection, referral, and continuity of care** by digitising the end-to-end workflow of community health volunteers.

## Workflow on the Field

### Household & Individual Registration
- Volunteers register households during door-to-door visits or when new families arrive (birth, marriage, migration).  
- Each individual is registered with demographic and health baseline details.  

### Screening
- Volunteers screen individuals for diabetes, hypertension, malnutrition, mental health, and anaemia.  
- Positive screenings lead to referral to health facilities for confirmation.  

### Enrolment
- If a condition is confirmed, individuals are enrolled into relevant follow-up programmes:  
  - **Diabetes / Hypertension**  
  - **Malnutrition (children 0–5 years)**  
  - **Mental Health**  
  - **Anaemia**  

### Follow-up
- Volunteers conduct follow-ups at home as per condition-specific schedules:  
  - Diabetes/HTN: Monthly  
  - Malnutrition: Weekly (for infants) or monthly  
  - Mental Health: Biweekly, then monthly  
  - Anaemia: Monthly  
- App guides volunteers with condition-specific questions.  

### Exit & Cancel
- Patients exit due to recovery, migration, refusal, or death.  
- Temporary migration or short-term unavailability leads to “Follow-up Cancel” status.  

### Reporting
- Volunteers submit monthly reports through the app.  
- Supervisors use these for oversight and planning.
