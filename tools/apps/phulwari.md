# Digitisation of the Rural Creche Program

## Splash Screen Summary
**“Digitising rural creches for healthier childhoods.”**  
This app streamlines the work of rural creche supervisors by digitising attendance, growth monitoring, and health tracking. It enables supervisors to record daily attendance, monitor child nutrition using WHO growth standards, and ensure timely follow-ups—supporting healthier growth and early interventions for children in rural areas.

## Purpose of the App
The app digitises and simplifies the workflow of rural creches. Supervisors can take daily attendance, monitor child growth, and track essential health interventions like deworming. By automating reminders for absentees and providing structured growth reports, the app strengthens the program’s ability to ensure consistent care and timely action for children’s health and development.

## Workflow on the Field
1. **Take Daily Attendance**  
   - Supervisors record children’s presence each day.  
   - Children absent for 3 consecutive days trigger an automatic home follow-up task.  

2. **Growth Monitoring**  
   - Once a month, supervisors record each child’s weight and height.  
   - The app automatically plots data against WHO growth standards.  
   - Children are classified into categories (Normal, Underweight, Stunted, Wasted, Overweight, Obese).  

3. **Health Tracking**  
   - Record Albendazole (deworming) tablets administered to children.  
   - Maintain a digital health history of each child.  

4. **Sync & Review**  
   - Data is synced (online or offline) to ensure visibility at all program levels.  
   - Coordinators review dashboards and reports to identify trends and intervene where needed.  

5. **Program-Level Insights**  
   - Aggregated data helps coordinators and decision-makers track malnutrition trends, absenteeism, and program impact.  
   - Enables better planning for nutrition, health, and family outreach activities.
